The **Inflation** page provides a detailed examination of inflation dynamics and the monetary policies
implemented by central banks. It explains how policy rate adjustments influence economic activity
and manage inflation levels. The discussion is rooted in a rich financial literature that covers
classical and contemporary theories of inflation, including the impacts of demand-pull and
cost-push factors. In addition, the page integrates historical data analyses to elucidate
the interplay between inflation trends, interest rates, and broader macroeconomic stability.

The **Investing** page offers an in-depth simulation of various investment strategies
using prominent ETFs. Here, you can explore both Lump Sum and Dollar Cost Averaging
methods, analyzing their respective impacts on portfolio value over time. The page
digs into established financial literature, discussing core concepts such as
risk-return tradeoffs, volatility, and maximum drawdowns. It reflects on modern
portfolio theory and empirical studies on market behavior, providing a comprehensive
view of how diversified investments can perform in different market conditions.

**Note that this is a work and progress and definitely not done yet.**
